###XMPP Features
SC works with every XMPP server out there. However XMPP is an extensible
protocol. These extensions are standardized as well in so called XEPâ€™s. SC
supports a couple of those to make the overall userexperience better. There is a
chance that your current XMPP server does not support these extensions.
Therefore to get the most out of SC you should consider either switching to an
XMPP server that does or - even better - run your own XMPP server for you and
your friends.
These XEPs are - as of now:
* XEP-0280: Message Carbons which automatically syncs the messages you send to
  your desktop client and thus allows you to switch seamlessly from your mobile
  client to your desktop client and back within one conversation.
* XEP-0237: Roster Versioning mainly to save bandwith on poor mobile connections
